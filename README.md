# Comments and Concerns

During Phase C of the project, we explained to our CA mentor that we were unable to find reliable data to support
our ambitions of performing queries on our data based on the revenue a song featured on TikTok has generated. Thus,
we decided to use websites explaining the estimation of how much revenue can be generated based on the number of streams
a song receives on a major platform, such as Spotify. We then estimated the revenue each song could have made and paired the revenues with the specific audio id for each of the songs looked at in our database. We hope that this estimation can 
still allow us to bring in our economic domain of interest and compare the popularity, likes, and other characteristics of a 
tiktok video against certain revenue indicators to make the project more interesting.
