# Revenue
* We were unable to find a dataset matching audioids to their respective revenue figures. We decided to fix this problem by estimating
the revenue for each song by multiplying 0.003 by the number of streams on spotify. Information about this means of estimation can be 
found from https://freeyourmusic.com/blog/how-much-does-spotify-pay-per-stream. The estimation for the revenue made by a song is found in revenue.txt
